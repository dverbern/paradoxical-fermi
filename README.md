# paradoxical-fermi
This repository is where I plan to store scripts that I've written to simplify my working life or just written for fun of the scripts I've written to simplify my working life ... or just for my own enjoyment.

Note:  The name of this repository is in reference to one of my favourite areas of intellectual discourse; 'The Fermi Paradox', concerning the presence/absence of alien life and whether we are alone.
